This is a sample implementation of a MicroSD card compatible bootloader
for Anbernic's RG405M/RG405V T618-based gaming handhelds.

It works by hijacking the device's recovery mode and re-routing the
boot flow into a 1st stage init script located in an exfat-formatted
MicroSD card's boot folder.

Ideally, one should use said 1st stage init script to bootstrap a
rootfs and execute a 2nd stage init script within said rootfs.

To build the bootloader simply execute the build.sh script.
You'll find the bootloader files in a newly created folder named sdboot.

Flash the created files into both vbmeta & vendor_boot slots of
your device to enable booting from MicroSD cards.

To boot from MicroSD card...

1) Hold down the Power button for 1.5 seconds
2) Add the Home/Back button to the mix (you're now holding two buttons)
3) Let go of both buttons once you see the boot logo
